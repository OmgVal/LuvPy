# we are now going to store the answer given by user

# name = input('what is your name? ')
# print(name)

# now name equals their answer 

# variables means value can change, its not fixed

# Exercise: Print length of answer given
# name = input('what is your name? ')
# print(len(name))

# len() is a function that counts the length or your string

# Jenny's Solution:
# name = input('whats your name? ')
# length = len(name)
# print(length)
