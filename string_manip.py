# When to use single/double quotes:
# use different quotes to help the computer determine when your string begins and end. for example:
# print('you start here and not "here, but you end" here')

# New line are made using '\n' a backslash and n
# print('hello\nhello')

# string concatenation is adding two strings together using +
